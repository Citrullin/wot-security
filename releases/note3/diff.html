<h2>
Abstract
</h2>
<p>
This
document
provides
non-normative
guidance
on
Web
of
Things
(WoT)
security
and
privacy.
The
Web
of
Things
is
descriptive,
not
prescriptive,
and
so
is
generally
designed
to
support
the
security
models
and
mechanisms
of
the
systems
it
describes,
not
introduce
new
ones.
However,
a
WoT
<del class="diff-old">system
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">System
</ins>
also
has
its
own
unique
assets,
such
as
a
Scripting
API
and
Thing
Descriptions,
that
need
to
be
protected
and
also
have
security
and
privacy
implications.
</p>
<p>
We
define
the
general
security
requirements
for
a
Web
of
Things
<del class="diff-old">system
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">(WoT)
System
</ins>
using
a
threat
model.
The
WoT
threat
model
defines
the
main
security
stakeholders,
security-relevant
assets,
possible
attackers,
attack
surfaces,
and
finally
threats
for
a
WoT
<del class="diff-old">system.
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">System.
</ins>
Using
this
generic
WoT
threat
model
for
guidance,
it
should
be
possible
to
select
a
specific
set
of
security
objectives
for
a
concrete
WoT
<del class="diff-old">system
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">System
</ins>
implementation.
We
provide
several
examples
using
common
scenarios
based
on
home,
enterprise,
and
industrial
use
cases.
We
also
provide
more
general
suggestions
for
the
design
and
deployment
of
a
secure
WoT
<del class="diff-old">system.
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">System.
</ins>
All
recommendations
are
linked
to
the
corresponding
WoT
threats
in
the
generic
woT
threat
model
in
order
to
facilitate
understanding
of
why
they
are
needed.
</p>
<p>
It
is
not
the
intention
of
this
document
to
limit
the
set
of
security
mechanisms
that
can
be
used
to
secure
a
WoT
<del class="diff-old">network.
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">System.
</ins>
In
particular,
while
we
provide
examples
and
recommendations
based
on
the
best
available
practices
in
the
industry,
this
document
contains
informative
statements
only.
Specific
normative
security
aspects
of
the
WoT
specification
are
defined
in
the
corresponding
normative
WoT
documents
for
each
WoT
building
block.

the
following
states:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
Manufactured:
</strong>
The
WoT
<del class="diff-old">device
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Device
</ins>
has
been
manufactured
by
an
OEM.
It
might
have
a
WoT
runtime
present
that
enables
single
or
multi-tenant
users
or
it
might
only
have
network
interfaces
exposed
present
that
are
compatible
with
a
WoT
description.
From
the
Manufactured
state,
based
on
the
deployment
scenario,
the
device
can
transition
to
either
of
two
states:
the
Installation/Commissioning
state
or
the
Security
Provisioning
state.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Installation/Commissioning:
</strong>
A
WoT
<del class="diff-old">device
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Device
</ins>
has
been
installed
into
its
intended
deployment
environment
by
a
system
provider
or
system
integrator
and
any
necessary
SW
configuration
has
been
performed.
In
practice
this
state
may
be
combined
with
or
reordered
with
the
Security
Provisioning
state.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Security
Provisioning:
</strong>
A
WoT
<del class="diff-old">device
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Device
</ins>
is
provisioned
with
the
security
metadata
and
credentials
needed
during
its
Operational
state.
The
exact
set
of
necessary
credentials
will
vary
based
on
the
WoT
<del class="diff-old">device's
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Device's
</ins>
deployment
model
and
choice
of
security
mechanisms.

Maintenance

Update:

A

This

an

General
<a class= "self-link" aria-label="§" href="#general">
</a>
</h3>
<p>
In
general
using
the
WoT
approach
should
"do
no
harm":
the
security
of
any
protocols
should
be
maintained.
The
Web
of
Things
does
not
introduce
new
security
mechanisms,
but
should
preserve
the
functionality
and
security
of
existing
mechanisms.
We
also
have
the
following
requirements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
Exposing:
</strong>
When
exposing
a
TD,
especially
via
the
Scripting
API,
it
should
be
possible
to
use
best
practices
for
security,
including
maintaining
the
integrity
of
the
TD
and
delivering
it
only
to
authorized
recipients.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Consuming:
</strong>
A
consumed
TD
should
accurately
reflect
the
actual
security
status
of
the
device
it
describes.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Protocols:
</strong>
The
WoT
can
potentially
apply
to
many
protocols
but
to
limit
scope
in
this
discussion
we
will
focus
on
the
needs
of
HTTP(S),
CoAP(S),
and
MQTT(S).

Threat
Model
<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href= "#wot-threat-model">
</a>
</h3>
<p>
Due
to
the
large
diversity
of
devices,
use
cases,
deployment
scenarios
and
requirements
for
WoT
Things,
it
is
impossible
to
define
a
single
WoT
threat
model
that
would
fit
every
case.
Instead
we
describe
here
an
overall
WoT
threat
model
framework
that
can
be
adjusted
by
OEMs
or
other
WoT
<del class="diff-old">system
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">System
</ins>
users
or
providers
based
on
their
concrete
security
requirements.
This
framework
gives
a
set
of
possible
threats
that
implementers
should
consider,
but
which
may
or
may
not
apply
to
their
<del class="diff-old">system.
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">WoT
System.
</ins>
</p>
<p>
When
selecting
suitable
mitigations
to
the
WoT
threats
described,
it
is
important
to
consider
various
criteria
that
might
increase
the
risk
level
for
a
particular
WoT
architecture,
such
as
handing
privacy-sensitive
data,
physical
safety
of
individuals
or
the
surrounding
environment,
high
availability
requirements,
and
so
forth.
In
addition
threat
mitigations
will
always
be
limited
by
the
capabilities
of
underlying
devices,
their
list
of
supported
security
protocols,
processes
isolation
capabilities,
etc.

assumes

the

<ins class="diff-chg">System
</ins>
using
standard
WoT

and
WoT

In
order
to
minimize
the
attack
surface,
it
is
strongly
recommended
that
no

means
is
provided
for
this

This

makes
the
assumption
that
this

is
followed.
It
is
also
assumed
that
WoT

are
trusted

<p>
In
this
scenario
we
assume
a

home
environment
with
a
WoT
<del class="diff-old">network
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">System
</ins>
running
behind
a
firewall
NAT
that
separates
it
from
the
rest
of
the
Internet.
However
the
WoT
<del class="diff-old">network
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">System
</ins>
is
shared
with
the
standard
user
home
network
that
contains
other
non-WoT
<del class="diff-old">devices
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Devices
</ins>
that
have
high
chances
of
being
compromised.
This
results
in
viewing
these
non-WoT
<del class="diff-old">devices
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Devices
</ins>
as
possible
network
attackers
with
access
to
the
WoT
<del class="diff-old">network
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">System
</ins>
and
its
APIs/Protocol
Bindings.
Other
assumptions:
WoT
scripts
and
protocol
bindings
are
considered
trusted;
a
single

on
physical
WoT

Scenario
2
-
Business/Corporate
Environment
<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href= "#scenario-2-business-corporate-environment">
</a>
</h4>
<p>
In
this
scenario
we
assume
an
office
building
environment
shared
between
a
number
of
independent
companies
(tenants)
with
a
shared
WoT
<del class="diff-old">network
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">System
</ins>
running
that
controls
temperature,
lights,
video
surveillance,
air
etc.
The
companies
sharing
the
premises
do
not
trust
each
other
and
can
be
viewed
as
potential
attackers.
However,
we
assume
that
there
is
a
trusted
non-compromised
<a href= "#dfn-system-provider" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
System
Provider
</a>
that
sets
the
WoT
<del class="diff-old">network
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">System
</ins>
through
the
whole
building
and
handles
the
on-boarding
and
termination
process
for
all
building
tenants
(making
sure
that
after
company
leaves
the
building,
all
its
data
is
not
present
in
the
WoT
<del class="diff-old">system
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">System
</ins>
anymore).
Compared
to
Scenario
1
above,
the
main
challenge
here
is
to
securely
share
the
WoT
<del class="diff-old">network
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">System
</ins>
between
these
companies
and
make
sure
their
WoT
<a href="#dfn-system-user-data" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
System
User
Data
</a>
(that
can
include
highly
confidential
company
information)
is
not
exposed,
tampered
with,
etc.
Additionally
one
has
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
a
set
of
building
tenants
might
change
from
time
to
time,
including
employee
turnover
in
each
company.
Therefore
the
WoT
setup
must
be
flexible
enough
to
start
and
terminate
access
to
the
WoT
<del class="diff-old">system
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">System
</ins>
promptly
to
both
companies
(entire
sets
of
users)
and
individuals.
Privacy
is
also
important
here,
because
companies
need
to
make
sure
that
the
data
about
their
employees
or
clients
is
well
protected,
including
such
information
as
employee
presence.
Since
we
assume
the
presence
of
a
trusted
<a href="#dfn-system-provider" class= "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
System
Provider
</a>,
we
can
consider
the
WoT
scripts
and
protocol
bindings
to
be
trusted
also.
Similar
to
Scenario
1,
there
is
only
a
single
<a href= "#dfn-system-provider" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
System
Provider
</a>
present
on
physical
WoT
<del class="diff-old">devices,
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Devices,
</ins>
and
no
dynamic
installation
of
WoT
scripts
are
possible
for
simplicity.

Scenario
3
-
Industrial/Critical
Infrastructure
Environment
<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href= "#scenario-3-industrial-critical-infrastructure-environment">
</a>
</h4>
<p>
In
this
scenario
we
assume
an
industrial
factory
or
infrastructure
(power
plant,
water
distribution
system,
etc.)
environment
that
is
using
WoT
<del class="diff-old">network
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">System
</ins>
to
monitor
or
perform
certain
automation
tasks
in
its
Operational
Technology
(OT)
network.
Compared
to
other
scenarios
above,
the
main
challenge
here
is
to
guarantee
safety
and
availability
of
the
critical
infrastructure.
Therefore,
for
example,
Denial-Of-Service
attacks
must
be
mitigated
as
well
as
possible.
On
the
other
hand,
privacy
is
usually
less
important
for
this
scenario.
</p>
<p>
Similar
to
the
previous
scenarios,
we
assume
that
there
is
a
trusted
non-compromised
<a href="#dfn-system-provider" class= "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
System
Provider
</a>
that
sets
up
the
WoT
<del class="diff-old">network,
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">System,
</ins>
so
we
can
consider
all
WoT
scripts
and
protocol
bindings
to
be
trusted
also.
We
also
assume
there
is
only
a
single
<a href="#dfn-system-provider" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
System
Provider
</a>
present
on
physical
WoT
<del class="diff-old">devices
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Devices
</ins>
and
a
single
tenant
on
all
system,
and
assume
no
dynamic
installation
of
WoT
scripts
is
possible
for
simplicity.
</p>
<p>
Due
to
the
high
safety
and
availability
requirements
in
the
industrial
environment,
typically
the
WoT
<del class="diff-old">network
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">System
</ins>
(part
of
a
bigger
OT
network)
won't
be
shared
with
other
tenants
of
the
same
building
and
normally
won't
be
shared
with
the
general
IT
network
of
the
same
company.
The
IT
network
is
where
all
other
company
operations
are
happening,
for
example,
accounting.
We
also
don't
expect
factory
employees
to
browse
the
internet
in
the
coffee
break
using
the
OT
network
(and
ideally
not
the
IT
network;
in
some
companies,
a
third
network
is
even
provided
for
employee
personal
use
or
for
less-trusted
personal
devices.)
However,
usually
some
bridging
must
be
present
between
the
OT
and
IT
networking
in
order
to
support
monitoring
requirements,
so
these
networks
are
not
fully
isolated.
In
this
scenario,
the
risk
of
compromised
devices
and
applications
interacting
with
the
WoT
<del class="diff-old">network
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">System
</ins>
is
limited
but
nonetheless
present.
Therefore
the
usual
WoT
threats,
described
in
the
previous
scenarios,
still
apply,
if
a
malicious
application
or
device
gets
into
the
industrial
OT
WoT
<del class="diff-old">network.
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">System.
</ins>
</p>
<p>
Also,
a
factory
employee
with
authorized
access
to
the
OT
WoT
<del class="diff-old">network
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">System
</ins>
can
be
also
viewed
as
a
potential
attacker.
The
additional
security
challenge
in
this
case
is
role
management,
i.e.
distribution
of
authorized
accesses
between
the
actors
(factory
employees,
devices
with
actuators,
etc.)
in
such
a
way
that
a
single
misbehaving
actor
does
not
have
enough
authorization
to
endanger
the
safety
and
availability
of
the
whole
infrastructure.
Similar
to
the
case
in
Scenario
2,
the
ability
to
promptly
terminate
an
employees’
access
rights
to
the
WoT
<del class="diff-old">network
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">System
</ins>
when
necessary,
and
without
disrupting
other
activities,
is
essential.

Typically

A
TD
should

This

conflicts
with
the
needs
of
Linked

the
registration

their
use

A
compromise
needs
to
be
struck.
Mechanisms
to
notify
legitimate
users

a

when
a

identifier
has
changed
may
be
considered
if
frequent
updates
are
necessary.
It
should
be
at
least
possible
to
change
a
Thing's
identifier
by
re-provisioning
the
device
if
necessary.
Using
methods
to
limit
disclosure

Description.

</p>
<p>
When
a
TD
is
transferred
between
WoT
endpoints,
to
or
from
the
TD
hosting
service,
it
is
important
to
use
secure
protocols
guaranteeing
data
authenticity,
freshness
and
in
many
cases
confidentiality
(depending
on
whenever
a
TD
contains
any
confidential
or
privacy-sensitive
information).
TDs
should
not
be
provided
without
first
authenticating
the
requester
and
checking
that
they
have
authorization
to
access
the
requested
TDs.
If
end-to-end
TD
authenticity
or
confidentiality
is
required,
see
<a href="#sec-pract-end-to-end-security" class= "sec-ref">

Secure
Practices

</a>
for
more
specific
guidance.
When
a
TD
is
stored
at
the
end
device,
in
a
gateway
(e.g.
in
a
cache
or
directory
service)
or
in
remote
storage
(e.g.
an
archive),
its
authenticity
and
in
some
cases
confidentiality
should
also
be
protected
using
the
best
available
local
methods.

<strong>
Avoid
Exposing
Persistent
Unique
Identifiers
</strong>
</p>
<p>
When
defining
fields
exposed
by
a
TD
immutable
information
should
be
avoided,
especially
if
that
information
can
be
tied
to
a
particular
person
or
is
associated
with
personally
identifiable
information.
It
is
specifically
strongly
recommended
to
avoid
exposing
any
immutable
hardware
identifiers.
Instead
it
is
recommended
to
use
"soft
identifiers",
i.e.
identifiers
that
can
be
changed
at
some
point
during
the
device's
lifecycle.
Given
the
requirements
of
Linked
Data,
it
may
not
be
possible
to
change
the
identifier
during
the
Operational
state
of
a
device
without
additional
infrastructure
to
register
consumers
of
a
TD
and
notify
them
of
updates,
but
it
should
at
least
be
possible
during
(re-)provisioning.

recommendation

<strong>
Minimize
Publicly
Exposed
Information
in

</strong>
</p>
<p>
WoT
TDs
should
minimize
the
amount
of
information
that
is
publicly
available
about
a
WoT
Thing.
For
example,
the
TD
should
generally
not
identify
the
version
of
the
software
or
operating
system
a
device
is
running,
since
this
information
can
be
used
to
identify
vulnerable
systems.
Instead
the
TD
should
capture
all
information
needed
to
support
interoperability
without
reference
to
particular
implementations.

<p>
When

for
APIs
exposed
by
a

it
is
often
important
to
use
secure
protocols
guaranteeing
<a href= "#dfn-system-user-data" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">

authenticity
and
confidentiality.
Specifically,
HTTPS
(using

CoAPS
(using
DTLS),
and
MQTTS
(using
TLS)
should
be
used
if
any
kind
of
authentication
or
secure
access
is
required.
If
data
travels
many
intermediate
nodes
(potentially
malicious
or
not

end-to-end

methods
should
be
preferred.

<p>
If
end-to-end
authenticity
is
desired,
it
is
possible
to
sign
WoT
objects
(TDs,
<a href="#dfn-system-user-data" class= "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
System
User

</a>
)
with
either
digital
signatures
(using
asymmetric
cryptographic
primitives)
or
Message
Authentication
Codes
(MACs,
using
symmetric
cryptographic
primitives).
Such
digital
signatures
or
MACs
are
created
by
the
producers/issuers
of
the
objects
and
validated
by
consumers
of
the
objects
(which
should
reject
signed
the
objects
whose
signatures/MACs
are
invalid).
For
data
expressed
in
JSON,
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7515/">
RFC

provides
guidelines
for
computation
and

using
JSON-based

</p>
<p>
Similarly,
if
end-to-end
confidentiality
is
desired,
it
is
possible
to
encrypt

<p>
From
a
security
point
of
view
two
aspects
are
important
to
consider
in
this
scenario.
First,
the
WoT
<del class="diff-old">Client
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Consumer
</ins>
should
be
certain
that
it
is
talking
to
the
correct
WoT
Thing
and
not
to
some
other
device
exposed
on
the
same
network.
Users
intending
to
control
a
specific
device,
for
example
opening
a
garage
door,
want
to
make
sure
they
are
talking
to
their
own
garage
door
device.
In
security
terms
this
means
that
WoT
<del class="diff-old">Client
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Consumer
</ins>
must
have
a
way
to
authenticate
the
device
exposing
the
WoT
Thing.
Second,
upon
receiving
requests
from
a
WoT
<del class="diff-old">Client,
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Consumer,
</ins>
the
WoT
Thing
must
verify
the
the
WoT
<del class="diff-old">Client
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Consumer
</ins>
is
authorized
to
perform
such
requests.
For
example,
a
garage
door
must
only
process
"open"
requests
from
devices
associated
with
authorized
users
or
service
providers
and
not
from
arbitrary
passerby.
</p>
<p>
These
requirements
can
both
be
fulfilled
using
a
variety
of
different
security
mechanisms.
The
choice
of
concrete
security
mechanisms
depends
on
the
deployment
scenario,
as
well
as
capabilities
of
the
devices.
Either
or
both
the
WoT
<del class="diff-old">Client
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Consumer
</ins>
and
the
WoT
Thing
might
have
some
resource,
network
connectivity,
or
user
interface
constraints
that
may
limit
the
choice
of
security
mechanisms.
</p>
<p>
For
example,
suppose
the
WoT
Thing
is
actually
an
OCF
device
that
has
been
provided
with
a
Thing
Description.
This
is
a
reasonable
use
case
since
WoT
metadata
can
be
used
to
describe
OCF
devices,
which
have
RESTful
CoAP
and/or
HTTP
network
interfaces.
Since
the
WoT
only
describes
devices
during
operational
phase,
and
does
not
describe
onboarding
or
provisioning
processes,
we
have
to
refer
to
an
external
standard
(such
as
OCF)
that
does
specify
these
processes.
However,
it
should
be
clear
that
much
of
what
is
described
in
this
example
is
applicable
to
other
standards
or
even
to
custom
solutions.
</p>
<p>
The
WoT
<del class="diff-old">Client
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Consumer
</ins>
and
the
OCF
device
providing
the
network
interface
acting
as
the
WoT
Thing
can
use
one
of
the
following
methods
recommended
by
the
OCF
Security
Specification
[

(see
Section
10)
to
mutually
authenticate
each
other
given
that
there
is
a
way
to
supply
credential
information
required
for
authentication
during
provisioning:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
Symmetric
key
credentials.
</strong>
This
method
assumes
that
both
WoT
<del class="diff-old">Client
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Consumer
</ins>
and
the
device
exposing
WoT
Thing
have
pre-shared
symmetric
key
credentials.
Such
keys
can
be
established
during
device
provisioning/on-boarding
phase.
In
this
case,
since
this
is
actually
an
OCF
device,
it
can
use
one
of
the
methods
recommended
in
Section
7
[
<cite>
<a class="bibref" href="#bib-ocf17" title="The OCF Security Specification, version 1.0.0" data-link-type="biblio">
Ocf17
</a>

]
or
can
use
an
ad-hoc
security
protocol,
such
as
EC
Diffie-Hellmani,
based
on
other
existing
pre-shared
credentials.
See
Section
9.2.1

]
for
more
details
on
such
credential
types.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Raw
asymmetric
public
key
credentials.
</strong>
This
method
assumes
that
a
WoT
<del class="diff-old">Client
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Consumer
</ins>
has
been
provisioned
with
the
public
key
of
the
device
exposing
the
WoT
<del class="diff-old">thing
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Thing
</ins>
(and
vice
versa)
so
the
devices
are
able
to
mutually
authenticate
each
other.
Provisioning
of
public
keys
can
take
place
during
a
device
provisioning/on-boarding
phase.
In
the
case
of
OCF
devices,
this
can
take
place
using
one
of
the
methods
recommended

also
provides
more
details
on
this
credential
type
as
well
as
guidance
on

</li>
<li>
<strong>

This
method
assumes

<p>
Instead
of
assigning
different
access
tokens
to
different
WoT
Interfaces,
it
is
also
possible
to
group
related
WoT
Interfaces
under
some
group
or
capability
name
(i.e.
"Light
controls",
"House
access"
etc.)
and
assign
one
token
per
group
to
guard
any
such
interfaces.
This
can
provide
more
balanced
access
control
granularity
in
many
circumstances.
</p>
<p>
Suitable
choices
of
the
above
security
measures
allows
mitigation
of
the

threat.
</p>
<p>
In
addition
to
the
above
measures,
authenticity,
confidentiality
and
replay
protection
of
transferred
solution
data
and
of
TDs
between
the
WoT
<del class="diff-old">Client
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Consumer
</ins>
and
the
WoT
Thing
is
strongly
recommended
for
scenarios
where
an
attacker
can
observe
or/and
modify
the
traffic
in
the
WoT
<del class="diff-old">network.
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">System.
</ins>
While
TD
transfer
might
only
require
authenticity
protection,
the
solution
data
itself
usually
requires
protection
of
all
its
aspects.
This
helps
to
mitigate
the
following
threats:
<a href="#dfn-wot-communication-threat-td-authenticity" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">

</p>
<p>
Authenticity,
confidentiality
and

can
be
guaranteed
by
usage
of
secure
transport
protocols
to
exchange
data
between
the
WoT
<del class="diff-old">Client
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Consumer
</ins>
and
the
WoT
Thing,
such
as
TLS/DTLS.
If
the
underlying
protocol
does
not
provide
the
required
security
(such
as
plain
CoAP
run
over
a
non-(D)TLS
protected
channel),
then
authenticity
and
confidentiality
of
the
transferred
data
can
be
implemented
separately
on
the
application
layer.
The
recommended
method
for
doing
this
in
resource
constrained
environments
is
to
use
the
Object
Security
of
CoAP
(OSCoAP)
method
described
in
the
IETF
Object
Security
of
CoAP
(OSCoAP)
specification
draft
[

The
scenario
shown
in
<a href="#wot_client_thing_basic_2" class= "fig-ref" title= "Basic WoT Thing and WoT Consumer with TD provided from a Thing Directory">
Figure
<bdi class="figno">

</bdi>
</a>
is
similar
but
with
the
important
difference
that
a
Thing
description
is
not
stored
on
the
WoT
Thing
device
nor
returned
by
it
directly.
The
TD
is
instead
provided
to
the
WoT
<del class="diff-old">client
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Consumer
</ins>
from
a
Thing
Directory
residing
on
some
other
system,
such
as
a
cloud
server.
This
mode
may
be
useful
for
"retro-fitting"
existing
devices
with
Thing
Descriptions,
for
example,
or
when
more
secure
access
to
the

is
required
than

The
primary
additional

is
the

the
WoT

could
also
be
supported
by
a
service
running
on
a

Similarly
to
the

such

In

not
resource
constrained,
the
usage
of
TLS/DTLS
is
the
recommended
method.
In
case
the
remote

does
not
guarantee
the
secure
storage
and
delivery
of
Thing
Descriptions
to
the
WoT
<del class="diff-old">Client

<ins class="diff-chg">Consumer

or
in
case
the
remote

is
not
a
trusted
entity,
the
authenticity
of
the
Thing
Description
should
be
verified
using
other
methods
on
the
application
layer,
such
as
wrapping
the
Thing

a

This

<p>
As
an
alternative
to
the
use
of
a
split
proxy,
which
requires
a
trusted
remote
proxy
to
accept
interaction
requests
on
behalf
of
the
WoT
Thing,
a
secure
tunnel
(such
as
an
SSH
tunnel)
can
be
set
up
between
the
WoT
Thing
and
an
endpoint
in
the
cloud.
In
order
to
traverse
the
NAT
the
WoT
Thing
would
have
to
initiate
the
connection,
so
in
practice
this
would
be
a
reverse
tunnel
set
up
by
the
"server".
However,
then
a
port
made
available
by
the
Thing
would
be
made
available
directly
on
the
cloud
server
supporting
the
tunnel
endpoint,
possibly
mapped
to
a
different
port.
The
use
of
a
tunnel
for
NAT
traversal
is
shown
in
<a href= "#wot_client_thing_tunnel" class="fig-ref" title= "WoT Thing and WoT Consumer via Tunnel">

<p>
In
this
configuration
the
WoT
Thing
must
be
responsible
for
all
security,
including
(if
necessary)
certificates
appropriate
for
the
tunnel
endpoint
in
the
cloud.
i
This
implies
that
the
WoT
Thing
needs
to
be
relatively
powerful,
as
constrained
devices
may
not
be
able
to
support
security
mechanisms
suitable
for
direct
exposure
on
the
<del class="diff-old">internet.
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Internet.
</ins>
The
WoT
Thing
would
also
have
to
be
actively
maintained
and
patched.
If
the
WoT
<del class="diff-old">thing
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Thing
</ins>
provides
a
TD,
it
should
use
URLs
that
refer
to
the
tunnel
endpoint.
This
generally
means
that
the
port
used
for
the
local
side
of
the
tunnel
should
not
be
used
to
provide
local
connections
as
the
certificates
will
be
incorrect
for
local
connections.
Instead
a
separate
port
(and
possibly
a
separate
TD
with
local
URLs)
should
be
provided.
</p>
<p>
One
advantage
of
this
arrangement
is
that
communication
is
never
available
in
plaintext
on
either
the
gateway
or
the
client.
Specifically,
the
private
keys
for
end-to-end
communication
between
the
WoT
Thing
and
the
WoT
<del class="diff-old">Client,
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Consumer,
</ins>
assuming
a
secure
protocol
such
as
HTTPS
is
used,
never
need
to
be
made
available
to
either
the
local
gateway
or
to
the
cloud
portal.
In
other
words,
this
configuration
supports
end-to-end
encrypted
communication,
and
does
not
rely
on
trusting
either
the
gateway
or
the
cloud
portal.
Because
of
this,
it
is
not
technically
necessary
for
the
tunnel
to
be
over
SSH;
a
regular
IP
tunnel
would
suffice.
</p>
<p>
A
variation
of
this
is
shown
in
<a href= "#wot_client_thing_proxy" class="fig-ref" title= "WoT Thing and WoT Consumer via HTTPS/HTTP Proxy">
Figure
<bdi class="figno">
9
</bdi>
</a>.
A
reverse
tunnel
is
still
used
here,
but
terminates
in
a
local
port
"inside"
the
cloud
portal,
that
is,
the
local
port
is
not
made
visible
outside
the
cloud
portal's
firewall.
A
local
proxy
service
then
runs
inside
the
cloud
portal
and
provides
a
bridge
to
a
secure
external
network
interface.
For
example,
the
protocol
from
the
WoT
Thing
might
be
HTTP,
which
the
proxy
service
could
bridge
to
an
external
HTTPS
network
interface.
In
this
case,
the
tunnel
should
be
encrypted
(for
example,
using
SSH)
to
prevent
eavesdropping;
a
regular
IP
tunnel
is
not
sufficient.
Depending
on
the
configuration,
the
unencrypted
traffic
<del class="diff-old">(e.g.,
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">(eg
</ins>
HTTP)
may
also
be
visible
on
the
local
network.
In
this
case,
the
only
protection
would
be
from
that
provided
by
the
local
network,
<del class="diff-old">e.g.,
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">eg
</ins>
WPA.
If
such
a
relatively
unprotected
local
interface
is
<em>
not
</em>
desirable,
another
SSH
tunnel
can
be
used
between
the
WoT
Thing
and
the
<del class="diff-old">Gateway,
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Intermediary
WoT
Servient,
</ins>
or
the
WoT
Thing
can
act
as
its
own
gateway
(with
the
HTTP
traffic
protected
behind
a
firewall).
</p>
<p>
To
support
local
SSH
tunnels,
of
course
credentials
need
to
be
provisioned
between
the
gateway
and
the
cloud
portal.
However,
this
only
needs
to
be
done
once,
when
the
gateway
is
installed.
</p>
<p>
It
is
worth
emphasizing
that
the
security
in
this
configuration
is
weaker
than
in
the
end-to-end
tunnel
configuration.
In
particular,
unencrypted
traffic
is
available
both
locally
(on
the
local
network
and/or
inside
the
gateway)
and
in
the
cloud
portal.
Therefore
both
the
gateway
and
the
cloud
portal
need
to
be
trusted.
This
can
be
mitigated
somewhat
by
using
application-level
end-to-end
object
security

<p>
Yet
another
variant
of
this
approach
is
shown
in
<a href= "#wot_client_thing_proxy" class="fig-ref" title= "WoT Thing and WoT Consumer via HTTPS/HTTP Proxy">
Figure
<bdi class="figno">

</a>.
In
this
variant,
the
proxy
is
extended
to
support
caching.
This
means
that
the
proxy
may
not
always
forward
requests
to
the
WoT
Thing,
but
may
instead
respond
on
its
behalf
using
stored
state.
</p>
<p>
There
are
two
sub-variants
of
this
approach.
First,
a
simple
HTTP
Proxy
can
be
used
that
caches
responses
from
the
WoT
Thing.
For
example,
property
reads
might
return
an
exact
copy
of
an
earlier
cached
payload
if
only
a
small
amount
of
time
(for
some
configurable
value
of
"small")
has
elapsed
since
the
last
request
for
that
property.
However,
this
approach
still
requires
that
the
WoT
Thing
be
"always
on"
and
able
to
respond
as
a
server
in
case
cached
content
is
not
available
or
has
expired.
It
also
requires
some
care
on
the
part
of
the
WoT
Thing
to
mark
payloads
as
cacheable
or
uncacheable
and
configure
appropriate
time-to-live
values.

<p>
The
second
sub-variant,
shown
in
<a href= "#wot_client_thing_cachingproxy" class="fig-ref" title= "WoT Thing and WoT Consumer via HTTPS/HTTP Proxy">
Figure
<bdi class="figno">
10
</bdi>
</a>,
takes
advantage
of
the
metadata
provided
by
the
Thing
Description.
Specifically,
the
Thing
Description
indicates
which
interactions
are
"properties"
that
can
be
"observed".
The
proxy
service
can
"observe"
all
such
properties
and
maintain
copies
of
their
state
in
the
cloud
server
(it
is
also
possible
to
do
this
in
the
gateway,
a
sub-variant
of
this
pattern).
Then
when
a
request
comes
in
to
read
a
property,
it
can
be
read
from
the
stored
state.
However,
the
"observe"
pattern
allows
the
WoT
Thing
to
send
updates
on
its
own
schedule,
leading
to
greater
power
efficiency.
In
addition,
the
proxy
service
can
see
from
the
Thing
Description
which
network
interface
methods
are
"actions"
and
need
to
be
sent
directly
to
the
WoT
Thing.
This
reduces
the
need
for
the
WoT
Thing
to
mark
interactions
as
being
cacheable
or
not.
</p>
<p>
In
both
of
these
sub-patterns,
object
security
(that
is,
encryption
and
authentication
of
payloads
at
the
application
level)
can
be
used
to
preserve
confidentiality
and
integrity
if
necessary
[
<cite>
<a class="bibref" href="#bib-cose17" title= "CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)" data-link-type= "biblio">
COSE17
</a>
</cite>
].
A
caching
proxy
can
simply
store
and
return
copies
of
the
encrypted
data
representing
the
state
of
"private"
properties.
</p>
<p>
A
caching
proxy,
being
a
variant
of
the
proxy
configuration
discussed
above,
has
similar
security
caveats.

In

as
a
black
box
exposing
a
set
of
WoT
Interfaces
and
Thing

in
more
detail
with
Scripting
API
support
and
a
couple
of
scripts
running
inside
a
WoT
runtime.
For
this
case
we
consider
all
scripts
to
be
trusted
and
provisioned
to
the
device
by
a
single
trusted
entity
(for
example
by
the
manufacturer
during

<p>
Since
all
scripts
running
inside
the
WoT
runtime
are
considered
trusted
for
this
scenario,
there
is
no
strong
need
to
perform
strict
isolation
between
each
running
script
instance.
However,
depending
on
device
capabilities
and
deployment
use
case
scenario
risk
level
it
might
be
desirable
to
do
so.
For
example,
if
one
script
handles
sensitive
privacy-related
data
and
well-audited,
it
might
be
desirable
to
separate
it
from
the
rest
of
the
script
instances
to
minimize
the
risk
of
data
exposure
in
case
some
other
script
inside
WoT
gets
compromised
during
the
runtime.
Such
isolation
can
be
performed
within
the
WoT
Runtime
using
platform
security
mechanisms
available
on
the
device.
</p>
<p>
Depending
on
the
device
capabilities,
the
following
isolation
mechanisms
might
be
available:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
WoT
Runtime
enforced
isolation.
</strong>
This
is
the
basic
isolation
provided
by
the
WoT
Runtime
itself
and
is
based
on
restricting
the
API
exposed
to
the
scripts
running
within
the
WoT
Runtime.
The
exact
set
of
guarantees
depends
on
the
concrete
WoT
Runtime
implementation
and
might
vary.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Native
OS
process-based
isolation.
</strong>
This
method
relies
on
the
underlying
native
OS
to
provide
basic
isolation
guarantees
based
on
native
process
isolation.
The
exact
set
of
guarantees
depends
on
capabilities
of
native
OS,
but
it
usually
includes
at
least
memory
and
execution
content
isolation.
Some
other
mechanisms
like
Discretionary
Access
Controls
(DAC)
might
be
also
available.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Native
OS
advanced
isolation.
</strong>
An
OS
might
also
provide
a
stronger
set
of
measures
that
can
be
deployed
for
process-based
isolation.
Examples
of
such
measures
are
Mandatory
access
Control
(MACs
in
all
major
OSes),
OS-level
virtualization
(i.e.
namespaces
and
containers
in
Linux),
Cryptographic
methods
etc.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The
mechanisms
are
provided
in
the
order
from
weakest
to
the
strongest
isolation
method
and
can
be
used
in
combination.
In
order
to
choose
the
appropriate
mechanism
one
should
study
the
capabilities
of
the
underlying
device,
as
well
as
evaluate
the
risk
level
of
particular
deployment
scenario.
It
is
also
important
to
note
that
all
isolation
mechanisms
usually
affect
performance
and
might
require

In
order
to
address
these

one
should
utilize
the
strongest
isolation
method
available
on
the

to
separate

The

should
cover
execution

WoT

Purpose-built

Testing
Goals
</ins><a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href= "#testing-goals"></a></h3><p><ins class="diff-chg">
The
goal
of
WoT
security
testing
is
to
find
security
vulnerabilities
in
the
implementation
of
WoT
components,
so
they
can
be
mitigated.
This
can
be
broadened
to
finding
weaknesses
(potential
vulnerabilities)
since
mitigating
both
actual
</ins>
and
<del class="diff-old">tested
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">potential
vulnerabilities
is
sufficient
to
secure
a
system,
and
in
general
it
can
be
hard
to
determine
if
a
weakness
is
exploitable.
It
is
not
possible
in
general
to
prove
the
converse,
that
a
WoT
component
is
secure
(that
is,
that
it
has
no
vulnerabilities).
However,
thorough
security
testing
can
at
least
ensure
that
there
are
no
obvious
(easily
discoverable)
weaknesses
or
vulnerabilities
in
an
implementation.
</ins></p><p><ins class="diff-chg">
Furthermore,
the
goal
of
security
testing
for
an
implementor
is
to
identify
the
existence
of
weaknesses,
not
to
exploit
them
to
break
into
or
manipulate
a
system.
For
an
implementor,
the
priority
after
discovery
of
a
weakness
is
to
implement
a
mitigation
to
prevent
it
</ins>
from
<ins class="diff-new">being
exploited,
not
to
actually
find
or
create
an
exploit
and
use
it.
Not
all
weaknesses
are
vulnerabilities.
Fixing
actual
(exploitable)
vulnerabilities
should
have
a
higher
priority
than
simple
weaknesses,
so
an
implementor
may
want
to
also
determine
which
weaknesses
are
exploitable
in
order
to
prioritize
mitigations.

<p>
<ins class="diff-chg">Before
beginning
security
testing,
it
is
useful
to
determine
if
the
components
of
the
system
being
tested
have
been
implemented
following
good
and
up-to-date
security
practices.
What
we
really
want
to
do
is
identify
systems
that
use
known
insecure
practices,
for
which
vulnerabilities
are
known.
Many
times
such
vulnerabilities
will
be
obvious
from
the
WoT
Thing
Description,
and
can
be
identified
with
simple
tools.
</ins></p><p><ins class="diff-chg">
As
an
example,
suppose
a
WoT
Thing
combines
"basic"
authentication
with
plain
(unencrypted)
HTTP.
In
this
case
the
username
and
password
can
be
easily
recovered
from
the
header
information
of
the
unencrypted
HTTP
request
by
an
eavesdropper

for
example
by

by

Hiding
</ins>
the
<del class="diff-old">content
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">Thing
Descriptions
of
such
systems
is
not
really
a
solution:
this
is
equivalent
to
security
by
obscurity
which
is
widely
considered
to
be
ineffective.
Generally,
the
"secret
information"
allowing
access
to
a
system
should
be
in
the
form
of
easily
modifiable
keys,
not
engineering
details
which,
once
revealed,
cannot
be
easily
changed.
However,
certainly
mitigating
obvious
vulnerabilities
easily
discoverable
in
the
Thing
Description
should
be
a
high
priority.
Ideally
mitigation
is
accomplished
by
modifying
the
implementation
but
this
is
not
possible
in
all
cases.
If
the
implementation
cannot
be
modified
it
may
be
possible
to
achieve
partial
mitigation
by
securing
the
network
environment,
e.g.
by
using
a
VPN
or
encrypted
tunnels
to
encapsulate
the
vulnerable
network
traffic.

Another
point
to
note
is
that
a
Thing
Description
may
not
describe
all
the
network

of
a

A
Thing
may
have
a
Thing

that
describes
a
network
interface
that
follows
best
practices
and
may
pass
all
the
additional
security
tests
described

that

may
still
have
an

The
most
common

of
static

is
usage
of
a
static

tool
that
is
able
to
parse
a

highlight
potential

Usually
the
output
of

determine

better

it
is
important
to
remember
that
these

However,
below

A
security
testing
plan
focused
on
weakness
and
vulnerability
discovery
has
been
presented
that
leverages
existing
tools
and
approaches
for
web
services
and
emerging
tools
for
new
IoT-oriented
network
interfaces.
A
testing
plan
should
be
developed
suitable
for
each
system
developed
using
the
WoT
architecture
but
will
generally
consist
of
three
stages:

and
</ins><a href="#exploitation"><ins class="diff-chg">

A
vulnerability
is
a
weakness
with
a
known
exploit
and
should
have
priority
for
mitigation,
but
all
weaknesses
may
potentially
lead
to
vulnerabilities
and
ideally
all
weaknesses
would
be
mitigated
or
corrected.
In
general,
a
WoT
Thing
Description
can
be
used
to
describe
both
secure
and
insecure
systems,
and
in
fact
this
is
necessary
to
support
existing
devices,
which
may
or
may
not
themselves
be
intrinsically
secure.
However,
WoT
Thing
Descriptions
provide
new
opportunities
for
understanding
and
planning
security
testing
and
mitigations.
