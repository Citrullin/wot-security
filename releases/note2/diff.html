<h2>
Abstract
</h2>
<p>
This
document
provides
non-normative
guidance
on
Web
of
Things
(WoT)
security
and
privacy.
The
Web
of
Things
is
descriptive,
not
prescriptive,
and
so
is
generally
designed
to
support
the
security
models
and
mechanisms
of
the
systems
it
describes,
not
introduce
new
ones.
However,
a
WoT
system
also
has
its
own
unique
assets,
such
as
a
Scripting
API
and
Thing
Descriptions,
that
need
to
be
protected
and
also
have
security
and
privacy
implications.
</p>
<p>
We
define
the
general
security
requirements
for
a
Web
of
Things
system
using
a
threat
model.
The
WoT
threat
model
defines
the
main
security
stakeholders,
security-relevant
assets,
possible
attackers,
attack
surfaces,
and
finally
threats
for
a
WoT
system.
Using
this
generic
WoT
threat
model
<del class="diff-old">as
a
foundation,
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">for
guidance,
</ins>
it
should
be
possible
to
<del class="diff-old">build
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">select
</ins>
a
specific
set
of
security
objectives
for
a
concrete
WoT
system
implementation.
We
provide
several
examples
using
common
scenarios
based
on
home,
enterprise,
and
industrial
use
cases.
We
also
provide
more
general
<del class="diff-old">guidance
on
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">suggestions
for
</ins>
the
design
and
deployment
of
a
secure
WoT
system.
All
recommendations
are
linked
to
the
corresponding
WoT
threats
in
the
generic
woT
threat
model
in
order
to
facilitate
understanding
<ins class="diff-new">of
</ins>
why
they
are
needed.
</p>
<p>
It
is
not
the
intention
of
this
document
to
limit
the
set
of
security
mechanisms
that
can
be
used
to
secure
a
WoT
network.
In
particular,
while
we
provide
examples
and
recommendations
based
on
the
best
available
practices
in
the
industry,
this
document
contains
informative
statements
only.
Specific
normative
security
aspects
of
the
WoT
specification
are
defined
in
the
corresponding
normative
WoT
documents
for
each
WoT
building
block.

<p>
In

the

any

should
be
maintained.
The
Web

<strong>

When

especially
via

it

When

high

In

The

assumes

the

(which
might
reside

device,
such

a

communicates
with
<ins class="diff-new">a

WoT

using
standard
WoT

and

In
order
to
minimize
the

it
is
strongly
recommended
that
no

means
is

This

makes
the

It

This

Note
that

Then

to
cause

An
additional
reason
for
using
an

might
be
exposing
a
previously

vulnerable
interface
that
got
hidden
when
<ins class="diff-new">the

Compared
to

scenarios
above,
the
main
challenge
here
is
to
guarantee
safety
and
availability
of
the
critical

Therefore,
for
example,

<p>

</ins></p><p><ins class="diff-chg">
Due
to
the
high
safety
and
availability
requirements
in
the
industrial
environment,
typically
the
WoT
network
(part
of
a
bigger
OT
network)
won't
be
shared
with
other
tenants
of
the
same
building
and
normally
won't
be
shared
with
the
general
IT
network
of
the
same
company.
The
IT
network
is
where
all
other
company
operations
are
happening,
for
example,
accounting.
We
also
don't
expect
factory
employees
to
browse
the
internet
in
the
coffee
break
using
the
OT
network
(and
ideally
not
the
IT
network;
in
some
companies,
a
third
network
is
even
provided
for
employee
personal
use
or
for
less-trusted
personal
devices.)
However,
usually
some
bridging
must
be
present
between
the
OT
and
IT
networking
in
order
to
support
monitoring
requirements,
so
these
networks
are
not
fully
isolated.
In
this
scenario,
the
risk
of
compromised
devices
and
applications
interacting
with
the
WoT
network
is
limited
but
nonetheless
present.
Therefore
the
usual
WoT
threats,
described
in
the
previous
scenarios,
still
apply,
if
a
malicious
application
or
device
gets
into
the
industrial
OT
WoT
network.
</ins></p><p><ins class="diff-chg">
Also,
a
factory
employee
with
authorized
access
to
the
OT
WoT
network
can
be
also
viewed
as
a
potential
attacker.
The
additional
security
challenge
in
this
case
is
role
management,
i.e.
distribution
of
authorized
accesses
between
the
actors
(factory
employees,
devices
with
actuators,
etc.)
in
such
a
way
that
a
single
misbehaving
actor
does
not
have
enough
authorization
to
endanger
the
safety
and
availability
of
the
whole
infrastructure.
Similar
to
the
case
in
Scenario
2,
the
ability
to
promptly
terminate
an
employees’
access
rights
to
the
WoT
network
when
necessary,
and
without
disrupting
other
activities,
is
essential.

Avoid

</p>
<p>
When
defining
WoT
Interfaces
exposed
by
a
TD,
it
is
important
to
avoid
any
heavy
functional
processing
before
the
successful
authentication
of
a
WoT
client.
Any
publicly
exposed
network
interface
should
avoid
heavy
processing
altogether.

<p>
Network

exposed
by
a
TD

Interfaces)
should
only
provide
the
minimal
necessary
functionality,
which
helps
to
minimize
implementation
errors,
possibilities
for
exposing

DoS

Devices
should
be
strongly

the

should
not
expose
implementation

(for
example,
the

another

In

In

the

and
another
running

known
as
the

We
refer
to
this
configuration
as
a
"Split

because
the

of
the

together
act

The

e.g.,
it

known
to

as
the
Local

only
communicates
over
this

with
the

The

In

the

i
This
implies
that
the

One
advantage

that

the

In

this

supports

the

Because
of
this,
it
is
not
technically
necessary
for

a

would
suffice.

A
reverse
tunnel
is
still
used
here,
but
terminates
in
a
local
port
"inside"
the
cloud
portal,
that
is,
the
local
port
is
not
made
visible
outside
the
cloud
portal's
firewall.
A
local
proxy
service
then
runs
inside
the
cloud
portal
and
provides
a
bridge
to
a
secure
external
network
interface.
For
example,
the
protocol
from
the
WoT
Thing
might
be
HTTP,
which
the
proxy
service
could
bridge
to
an
external
HTTPS
network
interface.
In
this
case,
the
tunnel
should
be
encrypted
(for
example,
using
SSH)
to
prevent
eavesdropping;
a
regular
IP
tunnel
is
not
sufficient.
Depending
on
the
configuration,
the
unencrypted
traffic
(e.g.,
HTTP)
may
also
be
visible
on
the
local
network.
In
this
case,
the
only
protection
would
be
from
that
provided

e.g.,
WPA.
If
such
a
relatively
unprotected

desirable,
another
SSH

can
be
used

the

the
WoT

can
act

its

(with
the

To
support

of

credentials
need
to

this
only
needs
to
be
done
once,
when

It
is
worth

that
the
security

is
weaker
than

unencrypted

Therefore
both

In
this

the

is
extended
to

This
means
that
the

may
not

forward

may

respond

</ins></p><p><ins class="diff-new">
There
are
two
sub-variants
of
this
approach.
First,
a
simple
HTTP
Proxy
can
be
used
that
caches
responses
from
the
WoT

For
example,
property
reads
might
return
an
exact
copy

an

if
only
a
small
amount
of
time
(for
some

elapsed
since
the
last

However,
this
approach
still
requires
that
the

be
"always
on"
and
able
to
respond
as
a
server
in
case
cached
content
is
not

It
also
requires
some
care
on
the
part
of
the
WoT

to
mark
payloads
as
cacheable

uncacheable
and
configure
appropriate
time-to-live
values.

advantage
of
the
metadata
provided
by
the
Thing
Description.
Specifically,
the
Thing
Description
indicates
which
interactions
are
"properties"
that
can
be
"observed".
The
proxy
service
can
"observe"
all
such
properties
and
maintain
copies
of
their
state
in
the
cloud
server
(it
is
also
possible
to
do
this

a

Then
when

comes
in
to
read
a

it

be
read
from
the

However,
the
"observe"
pattern
allows
the
WoT
Thing
to
send
updates
on
its
own
schedule,
leading
to
greater
power
efficiency.
In
addition,
the
proxy
service
can
see
from
the
Thing
Description
which
network
interface
methods
are
"actions"
and
need
to
be
sent
directly
to
the
WoT

This
reduces
the
need

WoT

to
mark
interactions

not.

In

of

Such

the

<ul>
<li>
<strong>

</strong>
This
is
the
basic

itself
and

is
based

This

to
provide
basic

The

</p>
<p>
In
order
to
address
these
threats
one
should
utilize
the
strongest
isolation
method
available
on
the
device
to
separate
different
WoT
Runtimes.
The
isolation
should
cover
execution
context,
runtime
memory,
local
storage
and
resource
allocation
between
different
WoT
Runtimes.
</p>
<p>
In
addition
the
Thing
Manager
should
have
a
reliable
way
to
distinguish
between
different
tenants
in
order
to
securely
manage
provisioning
and
updates
of
scripts
into
the
corresponding
WoT
Runtime.
This
can
be
achieved
by
authenticating
the
tenant
using
one
of
the
authentication
methods
described
in
Section
