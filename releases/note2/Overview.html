    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>This document provides non-normative guidance on Web of
    Things (WoT) security and privacy. The Web of Things is
    descriptive, not prescriptive, and so is generally designed to
    support the security models and mechanisms of the systems it
    describes, not introduce new ones. However, a WoT system also
    has its own unique assets, such as a Scripting API and Thing
    Descriptions, that need to be protected and also have security
    and privacy implications.</p>
    <p>We define the general security requirements for a Web of
    Things system using a threat model. The WoT threat model
    defines the main security stakeholders, security-relevant
    assets, possible attackers, attack surfaces, and finally
    threats for a WoT system. Using this generic WoT threat model
    for guidance, it should be possible to select a specific set of
    security objectives for a concrete WoT system implementation.
    We provide several examples using common scenarios based on
    home, enterprise, and industrial use cases. We also provide
    more general suggestions for the design and deployment of a
    secure WoT system. All recommendations are linked to the
    corresponding WoT threats in the generic woT threat model in
    order to facilitate understanding of why they are needed.</p>
    <p>It is not the intention of this document to limit the set of
    security mechanisms that can be used to secure a WoT network.
    In particular, while we provide examples and recommendations
    based on the best available practices in the industry, this
    document contains informative statements only. Specific
    normative security aspects of the WoT specification are defined
    in the corresponding normative WoT documents for each WoT
    building block.</p>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The lifecycle of a WoT device is similar to the lifecycles
    of other IoT devices and services. Iy may in fact be identical
    if a WoT Thing Description is being used simply to describe an
    existing device implemented using another standard. However,
    for discussion purposes we will use the generic lifecycle shown
    in Figure <a href="#wot-lifecycle" class="fig-ref" title=
    "WoT Device Lifecycle">Figure <span class="figno">1</span></a>
    which includes the following states:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manufactured:</strong> The WoT device has been
      manufactured by an OEM. It might have a WoT runtime present
      that enables single or multi-tenant users or it might only
      have network interfaces exposed present that are compatible
      with a WoT description. From the Manufactured state, based on
      the deployment scenario, the device can transition to either
      of two states: the Installation/Commissioning state or the
      Security Provisioning state.</li>
      <li><strong>Installation/Commissioning:</strong> A WoT device
      has been installed into its intended deployment environment
      by a system provider or system integrator and any necessary
      SW configuration has been performed. In practice this state
      may be combined with or reordered with the Security
      Provisioning state.</li>
      <li><strong>Security Provisioning:</strong> A WoT device is
      provisioned with the security metadata and credentials needed
      during its Operational state. The exact set of necessary
      credentials will vary based on the WoT device's deployment
      model and choice of security mechanisms. The document
      <cite>The State-of-the-Art and Challenges for the Internet of
      Things Security</cite> [<cite><a class="bibref" href=
      "#bib-garcia17">Garcia17</a></cite>] refers to this stage as
      "Bootstrapping".</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Operational:</strong> The default operational state
        of WoT devices. Devices in this state are fully ready to
        communicate over WoT interfaces and satisfy their
        deployment's operational roles. From the Operational state
        a device can return to the Manufactured state if it is
        fully decommissioned and security de-provisioned (link E in
        Figure <a href="#wot-lifecycle" class="fig-ref" title=
        "WoT Device Lifecycle">Figure <span class=
        "figno">1</span></a>). It is also possible to perform only
        a partial reset of a device, if it only requires
        re-installation and recommissioning without security
        re-provisioning (link D in Figure <a href="#wot-lifecycle"
        class="fig-ref" title="WoT Device Lifecycle">Figure
        <span class="figno">1</span></a>). It is also possible that
        only security re-provisioning is needed without
        re-installation and re-commissioning (link C in Figure
        <a href="#wot-lifecycle" class="fig-ref" title=
        "WoT Device Lifecycle">Figure <span class=
        "figno">1</span></a>).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Maintenance and Security Update:</strong> A state
        that is entered when the device's software or configuration
        needs to be updated. This is an optional state that can be
        activated remotely or locally (link A in Figure <a href=
        "#wot-lifecycle" class="fig-ref" title=
        "WoT Device Lifecycle">Figure <span class=
        "figno">1</span></a>) on a WoT device depending on the
        deployment model and overall setup. This state can be
        required to maintain security, for example to patch SW
        vulnerabilities or perform security-related configuration
        updates, such as key revocation or certificate refresh.
        After maintenance or updates are done, the device normally
        returns to the Operational state (link B in Figure <a href=
        "#wot-lifecycle" class="fig-ref" title=
        "WoT Device Lifecycle">Figure <span class=
        "figno">1</span></a>).
      </li>
    </ul>The scope of this document only covers the Operational
    State of a WoT device with the assumption that all relevant
    security metadata and credentials has been successfully
    provisioned during the Security Provisioning state and are
    available transparently to the WoT runtime level.
    Security-related system management updates (such as the
    revocation and update of keys and other credentials), while
    important to maintaining the security of a system, are
    considered to be out of the scope of this document.

      General<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href=
      "#general"></a></h3>
      <p>In general using the WoT approach should "do no harm": the
      security of any protocols should be maintained. The Web of
      Things does not introduce new security mechanisms, but should
      preserve the functionality and security of existing
      mechanisms. We also have the following requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exposing:</strong> When exposing a TD,
        especially via the Scripting API, it should be possible to
        use best practices for security, including maintaining the
        integrity of the TD and delivering it only to authorized
        recipients.</li>
        <li><strong>Consuming:</strong> A consumed TD should
        accurately reflect the actual security status of the device
        it describes.</li>
        <li><strong>Protocols:</strong> The WoT can potentially
        apply to many protocols but to limit scope in this
        discussion we will focus on the needs of HTTP(S), CoAP(S),
        and MQTT(S).</li>
      </ul>

      Threat Model<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href=
      "#wot-threat-model"></a></h3>
      <p>Due to the large diversity of devices, use cases,
      deployment scenarios and requirements for WoT Things, it is
      impossible to define a single WoT threat model that would fit
      every case. Instead we describe here an overall WoT threat
      model framework that can be adjusted by OEMs or other WoT
      system users or providers based on their concrete security
      requirements. This framework gives a set of possible threats
      that implementers should consider, but which may or may not
      apply to their system.</p>
      <p>When selecting suitable mitigations to the WoT threats
      described, it is important to consider various criteria that
      might increase the risk level for a particular WoT
      architecture, such as handing privacy-sensitive data,
      physical safety of individuals or the surrounding
      environment, high availability requirements, and so forth. In
      addition threat mitigations will always be limited by the
      capabilities of underlying devices, their list of supported
      security protocols, processes isolation capabilities,
      etc.</p>

        put out of scope in the previous section.</p>
        <p>The WoT threat model assumes that the WoT Client (which
        might reside on a non-WoT device, such as a smartphone, a
        PC browser, etc.) communicates with a WoT network using
        standard WoT Interfaces and WoT Protocol Bindings. In order
        to minimize the attack surface, it is strongly recommended
        that no other separate communication means is provided for
        this purpose. This threat model makes the assumption that
        this recommendation is followed. It is also assumed that
        WoT Protocol Bindings are trusted and cannot be installed
        by untrusted parties.</p>

        <p>In this scenario we assume a standard home environment
        with a WoT network running behind a firewall NAT that
        separates it from the rest of the Internet. However the WoT
        network is shared with the standard user home network that
        contains other non-WoT devices that have high chances of
        being compromised. This results in viewing these non-WoT
        devices as possible network attackers with access to the
        WoT network and its APIs/Protocol Bindings. Other
        assumptions: WoT scripts and protocol bindings are
        considered trusted; a single <a href="#dfn-system-provider"
        class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">System
        Provider</a> exists on physical WoT devices; and no dynamic
        installation of WoT scripts is possible.</p>

        Threats</strong> are possible:</p>

              TD to state different authentication method or
              authority and forwards it to the intended device. The
              device follow the instructions in the modified TD and
              sends authentication request to the attacker's
              specified location potentially revealing its
              credentials, such as username and password. Similarly
              instead of modifying the legitimate TD, an attack
              might save it and use it later on, for example when
              it would be updated to a newer version. Then, an
              attacker substitutes a new version of the TD with an
              older version to cause DoS to a device trying to get
              an access to a resource. An additional reason for
              using an older TD might be exposing a previously
              available vulnerable interface that got hidden when
              the TD was updated to a newer version. This can be a
              stepping stone to conducting other attacks on the WoT

              listens for publicly broadcast TDs and sends this

              request to the destination WoT device. The
              destination WoT device accepts incorrect
              settings.<br>
              Another attack example is a replay of a legitimate
              WoT interface request to set a setting, for example,
              increase temperature of the house by a number of
              degrees. When repeated many times, it might not only
              make living environment unusable, but also might
              damage the heating equipment.<br>
              Another attack involves replaying an old legitimate
              WoT interface request that attacker intercepts while
              visiting the user's home, such as commands to unlock
              doors, stop camera recordings etc. from a different
              time when the user wants to get authorized access to
              the house.</td>

        "#scenario-2-business-corporate-environment"></a></h4>
        <p>In this scenario we assume an office building
        environment shared between a number of independent
        companies (tenants) with a shared WoT network running that
        controls temperature, lights, video surveillance, air etc.
        The companies sharing the premises do not trust each other
        and can be viewed as potential attackers. However, we
        assume that there is a trusted non-compromised <a href=
        "#dfn-system-provider" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
        "dfn">System Provider</a> that sets the WoT network through
        the whole building and handles the on-boarding and
        termination process for all building tenants (making sure
        that after company leaves the building, all its data is not
        present in the WoT system anymore). Compared to Scenario 1
        above, the main challenge here is to securely share the WoT
        network between these companies and make sure their WoT
        <a href="#dfn-system-user-data" class="internalDFN"
        data-link-type="dfn">System User Data</a> (that can include
        highly confidential company information) is not exposed,
        tampered with, etc. Additionally one has to take into
        account the fact that a set of building tenants might
        change from time to time, including employee turnover in
        each company. Therefore the WoT setup must be flexible
        enough to start and terminate access to the WoT system
        promptly to both companies (entire sets of users) and
        individuals. Privacy is also important here, because
        companies need to make sure that the data about their
        employees or clients is well protected, including such
        information as employee presence. Since we assume the
        presence of a trusted <a href="#dfn-system-provider" class=
        "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">System Provider</a>, we
        can consider the WoT scripts and protocol bindings to be
        trusted also. Similar to Scenario 1, there is only a single
        <a href="#dfn-system-provider" class="internalDFN"
        data-link-type="dfn">System Provider</a> present on
        physical WoT devices, and no dynamic installation of WoT
        scripts are possible for simplicity.</p>
        <p>In this scenario the following <strong>WoT
        Threats</strong> are possible:</p>

              <td>
                This attack is similar to the one described in
                Scenario 1 where a WoT network shares connectivity
                with other non-WoT devices (smartphones, PCs,
                etc.). In this case a company's employee can send a
                malformed request to a WoT device targeting a
                Protocol Binding interface directly. This malformed
                request causes the respective Protocol Binding to
                be compromised and attacker is able to run the code
                with the privileges of the Protocol Binding on the
                WoT device. As a result the attacker can get any

        "#scenario-3-industrial-critical-infrastructure-environment"></a></h4>
        <p>In this scenario we assume an industrial factory or
        infrastructure (power plant, water distribution system,
        etc.) environment that is using WoT network to monitor or
        perform certain automation tasks in its Operational
        Technology (OT) network. Compared to other scenarios above,
        the main challenge here is to guarantee safety and
        availability of the critical infrastructure. Therefore, for
        example, Denial-Of-Service attacks must be mitigated as
        well as possible. On the other hand, privacy is usually
        less important for this scenario.</p>
        <p>Similar to the previous scenarios, we assume that there
        is a trusted non-compromised <a href="#dfn-system-provider"
        class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">System
        Provider</a> that sets up the WoT network, so we can
        consider all WoT scripts and protocol bindings to be
        trusted also. We also assume there is only a single
        <a href="#dfn-system-provider" class="internalDFN"
        data-link-type="dfn">System Provider</a> present on
        physical WoT devices and a single tenant on all system, and
        assume no dynamic installation of WoT scripts is possible
        for simplicity.</p>
        <p>Due to the high safety and availability requirements in
        the industrial environment, typically the WoT network (part
        of a bigger OT network) won't be shared with other tenants
        of the same building and normally won't be shared with the
        general IT network of the same company. The IT network is
        where all other company operations are happening, for
        example, accounting. We also don't expect factory employees
        to browse the internet in the coffee break using the OT
        network (and ideally not the IT network; in some companies,
        a third network is even provided for employee personal use
        or for less-trusted personal devices.) However, usually
        some bridging must be present between the OT and IT
        networking in order to support monitoring requirements, so
        these networks are not fully isolated. In this scenario,
        the risk of compromised devices and applications
        interacting with the WoT network is limited but nonetheless
        present. Therefore the usual WoT threats, described in the
        previous scenarios, still apply, if a malicious application
        or device gets into the industrial OT WoT network.</p>
        <p>Also, a factory employee with authorized access to the
        OT WoT network can be also viewed as a potential attacker.
        The additional security challenge in this case is role
        management, i.e. distribution of authorized accesses
        between the actors (factory employees, devices with
        actuators, etc.) in such a way that a single misbehaving
        actor does not have enough authorization to endanger the
        safety and availability of the whole infrastructure.
        Similar to the case in Scenario 2, the ability to promptly
        terminate an employees’ access rights to the WoT network
        when necessary, and without disrupting other activities, is
        essential.</p>

          target WoT system downloads from a Thing Directory. In
          addition, loading JSON-LD context files might also leak
          WoT System configuration. For example, context files may
          be used to allow TDs to be extended with new protocols
          and security schemes; loading these context files then
          implies the TDs uses these protocols or schemes.</td>
          <td>The communication between WoT endpoints and a TD
          distribution service (i.e. Thing Directories) should be
          protected against eavesdroppers using well-established
          security protocols. It also should not be possible for a
          casual observer (for example, a guest visiting a person's
          home with access to a private wireless access point) to
          query available WoT devices (there has to be a way to
          limit WoT devices' ability to respond to different
          broadcast events) and as a result obtaining WoT System
          configuration. Caching on gateways can help with the

      <p><strong>Secure Delivery and Storage of Thing
      Description.</strong></p>
      <p>When a TD is transferred between WoT endpoints, to or from
      the TD hosting service, it is important to use secure
      protocols guaranteeing data authenticity, freshness and in
      many cases confidentiality (depending on whenever a TD
      contains any confidential or privacy-sensitive information).
      TDs should not be provided without first authenticating the
      requester and checking that they have authorization to access
      the requested TDs. If end-to-end TD authenticity or
      confidentiality is required, see <a href=
      "#sec-pract-end-to-end-security" class="sec-ref"><span class=
      "secno">6.5</span> <span class="sec-title">Secure Practices
      for end-to-end security</span></a> for more specific
      guidance. When a TD is stored at the end device, in a gateway
      (e.g. in a cache or directory service) or in remote storage
      (e.g. an archive), its authenticity and in some cases
      confidentiality should also be protected using the best
      available local methods.</p>
      <p>This recommendation helps prevent the following threats:
      <a href="#dfn-wot-communication-threat-td-authenticity"
      class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">WoT Communication
      Threat - TD Authenticity</a>, <a href=

      Threat - TD Confidentiality and Privacy</a>, <a href=

      configuration</a>, <a href="#dfn-tracking-wot-system-user"
      class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Tracking WoT System
      User</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Avoid Exposing Persistent Unique
      Identifiers</strong></p>
      <p>When defining fields exposed by a TD immutable information
      should be avoided, especially if that information can be tied
      to a particular person or is associated with personally
      identifiable information. It is specifically strongly
      recommended to avoid exposing any immutable hardware
      identifiers. Instead it is recommended to use "soft
      identifiers", i.e. identifiers that can be changed at some
      point during the device's lifecycle. Given the requirements
      of Linked Data, it may not be possible to change the
      identifier during the Operational state of a device without
      additional infrastructure to register consumers of a TD and
      notify them of updates, but it should at least be possible
      during (re-)provisioning.</p>
      <p>This recommendation helps prevent the following threats:
      <a href=
      "#dfn-wot-communication-threat-td-confidentiality-and-privacy"
      class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">WoT Communication
      Threat - TD Confidentiality and Privacy</a>, <a href=

      configuration</a>, <a href="#dfn-tracking-wot-system-user"
      class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Tracking WoT System
      User</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Minimize Publicly Exposed Information in
      TD</strong></p>
      <p>WoT TDs should minimize the amount of information that is
      publicly available about a WoT Thing. For example, the TD
      should generally not identify the version of the software or
      operating system a device is running, since this information
      can be used to identify vulnerable systems. Instead the TD
      should capture all information needed to support
      interoperability without reference to particular
      implementations.</p>

      <p><strong>Limit TDs exposure</strong></p>
      <p>Limit clients who can obtain a certain TD (or its

      methods. This can be done by exposing a number of TD variants
      for the same WoT Thing based on the level of client’s access.
      For example, versions of a TD for "public access" may be
      generated with a subset of information in the full TD,
      omitting (for example) support or version metadata.</p>

      <p><strong>Use Secure Transports</strong></p>
      <p>When defining protocols for APIs exposed by a TD, it is
      often important to use secure protocols guaranteeing <a href=
      "#dfn-system-user-data" class="internalDFN" data-link-type=
      "dfn">System User Data</a> authenticity and confidentiality.
      Specifically, HTTPS (using TLS), CoAPS (using DTLS), and
      MQTTS (using TLS) should be used if any kind of
      authentication or secure access is required. If data travels
      many intermediate nodes (potentially malicious or not
      privacy-preserving), end-to-end encryption methods should be
      preferred.</p>

      <p><strong>Avoid Heavy Functional Processing without

      <p>When defining WoT Interfaces exposed by a TD, it is

      altogether.</p>

      <p><strong>Minimize Network Interface Functionality and

      <p>Network interfaces exposed by a TD (WoT Interfaces) should
      only provide the minimal necessary functionality, which helps
      to minimize implementation errors, possibilities for exposing
      potentially sensitive data, DoS attack possibilities etc.
      Devices should be strongly encapsulated, meaning the network
      interfaces should not expose implementation details (for
      example, the use of particular software frameworks).</p>

      <p>If end-to-end authenticity is desired, it is possible to
      sign WoT objects (TDs, <a href="#dfn-system-user-data" class=
      "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">System User Data</a>) with
      either digital signatures (using asymmetric cryptographic
      primitives) or Message Authentication Codes (MACs, using
      symmetric cryptographic primitives). Such digital signatures
      or MACs are created by the producers/issuers of the objects
      and validated by consumers of the objects (which should
      reject signed the objects whose signatures/MACs are invalid).
      For data expressed in JSON, <a href=

      "figno">3</span></a> shows the basic WoT Client (which can be
      a browser or an application on a user's smartphone) used to
      directly operate a WoT Thing. The WoT Thing exposes a WoT
      network interface and also directly provides a Thing
      Description. The Thing Description describes the interactions
      that can be performed on the WoT Thing.</p>
      <figure id="wot_client_thing_basic">

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>From a security point of view two aspects are important to
      consider in this scenario. First, the WoT Client should be
      certain that it is talking to the correct WoT Thing and not
      to some other device exposed on the same network. Users
      intending to control a specific device, for example opening a
      garage door, want to make sure they are talking to their own
      garage door device. In security terms this means that WoT
      Client must have a way to authenticate the device exposing
      the WoT Thing. Second, upon receiving requests from a WoT
      Client, the WoT Thing must verify the the WoT Client is
      authorized to perform such requests. For example, a garage
      door must only process "open" requests from devices
      associated with authorized users or service providers and not
      from arbitrary passerby.</p>
      <p>These requirements can both be fulfilled using a variety
      of different security mechanisms. The choice of concrete
      security mechanisms depends on the deployment scenario, as
      well as capabilities of the devices. Either or both the WoT
      Client and the WoT Thing might have some resource, network
      connectivity, or user interface constraints that may limit
      the choice of security mechanisms.</p>
      <p>For example, suppose the WoT Thing is actually an OCF
      device that has been provided with a Thing Description. This
      is a reasonable use case since WoT metadata can be used to
      describe OCF devices, which have RESTful CoAP and/or HTTP
      network interfaces. Since the WoT only describes devices
      during operational phase, and does not describe onboarding or
      provisioning processes, we have to refer to an external
      standard (such as OCF) that does specify these processes.
      However, it should be clear that much of what is described in
      this example is applicable to other standards or even to
      custom solutions.</p>
      <p>The WoT Client and the OCF device providing the network
      interface acting as the WoT Thing can use one of the
      following methods recommended by the OCF Security
      Specification [<cite><a class="bibref" href=
      "#bib-ocf17">Ocf17</a></cite>] (see Section 10) to mutually
      authenticate each other given that there is a way to supply
      credential information required for authentication during
      provisioning:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Symmetric key credentials.</strong> This method
        assumes that both WoT Client and the device exposing WoT
        Thing have pre-shared symmetric key credentials. Such keys
        can be established during device provisioning/on-boarding
        phase. In this case, since this is actually an OCF device,
        it can use one of the methods recommended in Section 7
        [<cite><a class="bibref" href=
        "#bib-ocf17">Ocf17</a></cite>] or can use an ad-hoc
        security protocol, such as EC Diffie-Hellmani, based on
        other existing pre-shared credentials. See Section 9.2.1
        [<cite><a class="bibref" href=
        "#bib-ocf17">Ocf17</a></cite>] for more details on such
        credential types.</li>
        <li><strong>Raw asymmetric public key credentials.</strong>
        This method assumes that a WoT Client has been provisioned
        with the public key of the device exposing the WoT thing
        (and vice versa) so the devices are able to mutually
        authenticate each other. Provisioning of public keys can
        take place during a device provisioning/on-boarding phase.
        In the case of OCF devices, this can take place using one
        of the methods recommended in Section 7 [<cite><a class=
        "bibref" href="#bib-ocf17">Ocf17</a></cite>]. Section 9.2.3
        [<cite><a class="bibref" href=
        "#bib-ocf17">Ocf17</a></cite>] also provides more details
        on this credential type as well as guidance on its secure
        provisioning.</li>
        <li><strong>Certificates.</strong> This method assumes that
        the WoT Client has been provisioned with the certificate of
        the device exposing the WoT thing (and vice versa) so the
        devices are able to mutually authenticate each other. The
        provisioning of the certificates can take place during
        device provisioning/on-boarding phase using one of the
        methods recommended in Section 7 [<cite><a class="bibref"
        href="#bib-ocf17">Ocf17</a></cite>]. Section 9.2.5
        [<cite><a class="bibref" href=
        "#bib-ocf17">Ocf17</a></cite>] also provides more details
        on this credential type as well as Section 9.3.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In case it is not possible to pre-provision any of the
      types of credentials described above during the network setup
      phase or if the WoT Thing wants to use a more fine-grained
      access control policy on the WoT network interfaces it is
      exposing (for example, different controls might require
      different levels of authorization), the following methods can
      be used instead:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>OAuth 2.0-based access tokens.</strong> These
        tokens follow the JSON Web Token (JWT) format defined in
        RFC 7519 [<cite><a class="bibref" href=
        "#bib-jwt15">JWT15</a></cite>] and should used according to
        the suggestions by the IETF Authentication and
        Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE)
        specification draft [<cite><a class="bibref" href=
        "#bib-ietface">IETFACE</a></cite>]. These are recommended
        for devices that are able to use the HTTP protocol and do
        not have significant resource constraints.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof-of-possession (PoP) tokens.</strong>
        These are extensions of the OAuth 2.0-based access tokens
        that follow the CBOR web token (CWT) format
        [<cite><a class="bibref" href=
        "#bib-cbor17">CBOR17</a></cite>]. The IETF Authentication
        and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE)
        specification draft [<cite><a class="bibref" href=
        "#bib-ietface">IETFACE</a></cite>] recommends such tokens
        for resource-constrained devices using the COAP protocol
        instead of HTTP. For details of using such tokens please
        see [<cite><a class="bibref" href=
        "#bib-ietface">IETFACE</a></cite>].</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Instead of assigning different access tokens to different
      WoT Interfaces, it is also possible to group related WoT
      Interfaces under some group or capability name (i.e. "Light
      controls", "House access" etc.) and assign one token per
      group to guard any such interfaces. This can provide more
      balanced access control granularity in many
      circumstances.</p>
      <p>Suitable choices of the above security measures allows
      mitigation of the <a href=
      "#dfn-wot-interface-threat-unauthorized-wot-interface-access"
      class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">WoT Interface Threat
      - Unauthorized WoT Interface Access</a> threat.</p>
      <p>In addition to the above measures, authenticity,
      confidentiality and replay protection of transferred solution
      data and of TDs between the WoT Client and the WoT Thing is
      strongly recommended for scenarios where an attacker can
      observe or/and modify the traffic in the WoT network. While
      TD transfer might only require authenticity protection, the
      solution data itself usually requires protection of all its
      aspects. This helps to mitigate the following threats:

      <p>Authenticity, confidentiality and replay protection can be
      guaranteed by usage of secure transport protocols to exchange
      data between the WoT Client and the WoT Thing, such as
      TLS/DTLS. If the underlying protocol does not provide the
      required security (such as plain CoAP run over a non-(D)TLS
      protected channel), then authenticity and confidentiality of
      the transferred data can be implemented separately on the
      application layer. The recommended method for doing this in
      resource constrained environments is to use the Object
      Security of CoAP (OSCoAP) method described in the IETF Object
      Security of CoAP (OSCoAP) specification draft
      [<cite><a class="bibref" href=

      <p>The scenario shown in <a href="#wot_client_thing_basic_2"
      class="fig-ref" title=
      "Basic WoT Thing and WoT Client with TD provided from a Thing Directory">
      Figure <span class="figno">4</span></a> is similar but with
      the important difference that a Thing description is not
      stored on the WoT Thing device nor returned by it directly.
      The TD is instead provided to the WoT client from a Thing
      Directory residing on some other system, such as a cloud
      server. This mode may be useful for "retro-fitting" existing
      devices with Thing Descriptions, for example, or when more
      secure access to the TD is required than the device itself
      can support.</p>

      <p>The primary additional security consideration of this
      scenario is the need for the secure transfer of the TD
      between the WoT Client and the Thing Directory. The Thing
      Directory can reside in a gateway but could also be supported
      by a service running on a remote cloud or other remote
      location. Similarly to the methods described above such
      transfer should be done using secure transport protocols. In
      the case that the WoT Client is not resource constrained, the
      usage of TLS/DTLS is the recommended method. In case the
      remote cloud does not guarantee the secure storage and
      delivery of Thing Descriptions to the WoT Client or in case
      the remote cloud is not a trusted entity, the authenticity of
      the Thing Description should be verified using other methods
      on the application layer, such as wrapping the Thing
      Description into a protected CBOR Object Encryption and
      Signing (COSE) object [<cite><a class="bibref" href=
      "#bib-cose17">COSE17</a></cite>]. This can be done by the
      provider of the Thing Description and verified by the WoT
      Client after the download from the remote cloud.</p>

      contrast to the basic (direct connection) case, the
      interaction between the WoT Client and the WoT Thing is now
      mediated by a WoT Servient Gateway. The WoT Servient Gateway
      exposes a WoT interface and provides a Thing Description that
      describes interactions that that apply to the Thing. In
      general, the TD provided by the WoT Servient Gateway is
      structurally identical to the one that would have been
      provided by the Thing directly, except for any necessary
      modifications to URLs, protocols used, and (perhaps) a
      modified security configuration.</p>

      <p>From a security standpoint this case is quite similar to
      the one described in Section <a href=
      "#wot-client-server-basic" class="sec-ref"><span class=
      "secno">7.1</span> <span class="sec-title">Basic Interaction
      between WoT Thing and WoT Client</span></a>. The main
      difference is that mutual authentication should be
      established between all directly communicating parties, i.e.
      between the WoT Client and the WoT Servient Gateway, as well
      as between the WoT Servient Gateway and the device exposing
      the WoT Thing network interface. If there is no direct
      communication between the WoT Servient Gateway and the device
      providing the WoT Thing however the mutual authentication
      between them is redundant. The authentication mechanisms
      described in Section <a href="#wot-client-server-basic"
      class="sec-ref"><span class="secno">7.1</span> <span class=
      "sec-title">Basic Interaction between WoT Thing and WoT
      Client</span></a> are also applicable for this case.</p>
      <p>The Thing Description that the WoT Servient Gateway device
      provides to the WoT Client can be the same as it gets from
      the device exposing the WoT Thing or it can be modified to
      better suit the deployment use case or expose additional
      functionality via the WoT Gateway. It is also possible that
      the end device behind the WoT Gateway is a non-WoT device and
      does not provide any Thing Description on its own, and may
      not support any interaction via a WoT-compatible network
      Interface. In this case the WoT Servient Gateway has to build
      the Thing Description by itself i and expose it to the WoT
      Client. For all typical use cases, the WoT Servient Gateway
      should be considered a trusted entity and in this case it can
      freely modify or build Thing Descriptions it exposes as well
      as set up fine-grained access controls on different exposed
      WoT Interfaces. The WoT Servient Gateway can do this using
      the same methods described in Section <a href=

      "secno">7.1</span> <span class="sec-title">Basic Interaction

      title=
      "WoT Thing and WoT Client via Gateway with Remote Cloud">Figure
      <span class="figno">6</span></a> is similar to the previous

      not provided by the the WoT Servient Gateway, but can be
      fetched by the WoT client from a Thing Directory residing on
      a remote system. Similar to the previous case, this Thing
      Description can either be the original Thing Description
      supplied by the end device or modified by the WoT Servient
      Gateway. Regardless of the actual setup, the transfer of a
      Thing Description between any two endpoints should be done
      using underlying secure protocols. Currently the use of TLS
      or DTLS is recommended. Similarly to Section <a href=

      title="WoT Thing and WoT Client via Split Proxy">Figure
      <span class="figno">7</span></a> shows another common
      situation where the WoT Thing resides in a local protected
      network, e.g. behind a NAT/Firewall. In this case the WoT
      Client cannot contact the WoT Thing directly. In the
      configuration shown here the communication between the WoT
      Client and the WoT Thing is handled via a pair of Wot Gateway
      Servients: one residing in the local protected network, known
      as the Local Gateway, and another running in the cloud, known
      as the Remote Gateway. We refer to this configuration as a
      "Split Proxy" because the combination of the Local and Remote
      Proxy together act like a single proxy service. The Local and
      Remote Gateway Servients are connected with a secure channel
      (which may be non-WoT, e.g., it does not have to use a protocol
      known to WoT) as the Local Gateway Servient only communicates
      over this channel with the Remote Gateway Servient. The WoT
      Remote Gateway Servient should use the mechanisms described
      in Section <a href="#wot-client-server-basic" class=
      "sec-ref"><span class="secno">7.1</span> <span class=
      "sec-title">Basic Interaction between WoT Thing and WoT
      Client</span></a> in order to authenticate and authorize the
      WoT Client before processing any of its requests. Similar to
      the configurations described in Section <a href=
      "#wot-client-server-basic" class="sec-ref"><span class=
      "secno">7.1</span> <span class="sec-title">Basic Interaction
      between WoT Thing and WoT Client</span></a>, secure protocols
      should be used to protect authenticity and confidentiality
      and provide replay protection when data is exchanged between
      the WoT Client and the Remote Gateway Servient. If the WoT
      Client is authorized, then the Remote Gateway Servient can
      package the WoT request and transfer it over the secure
      channel to the Local Gateway Servient, which in turn can
      issue requests to the WoT Thing on the local network. The
      local network channel between the Local Gateway Servient and
      the WoT Thing can be left unprotected (relying purely on the
      closed nature of the local network), but it is strongly
      recommended to employ suitable additional security mechanisms
      as described in Section <a href="#wot-client-server-basic"
      class="sec-ref"><span class="secno">7.1</span> <span class=
      "sec-title">Basic Interaction between WoT Thing and WoT

      of involved parties (WoT Thing and Local Gateway Servient),
      as well as to provide confidentiality and integrity of
      transferred solution data and the TD.</p>

      <p>An alternative security setup for this scenario can use
      end-to-end security authentication and authorization. In this
      case the WoT Client would not only need to authenticate and
      authorize itself to the Remote Gateway Servient, but also to
      the WoT Thing. In this case it would need a separate set of
      security credentials, required to successfully authenticate
      with each party. The exposed TD should indicate the
      mechanisms to obtain these credentials, e.g. via OAuth2.</p>

      Thing and WoT Client via a Tunnel<a class="self-link"
      aria-label="§" href="#wot-client-server-tunnel"></a></h3>
      <p>As an alternative to the use of a split proxy, which
      requires a trusted remote proxy to accept interaction
      requests on behalf of the WoT Thing, a secure tunnel (such as
      an SSH tunnel) can be set up between the WoT Thing and an
      endpoint in the cloud. In order to traverse the NAT the WoT
      Thing would have to initiate the connection, so in practice
      this would be a reverse tunnel set up by the "server".
      However, then a port made available by the Thing would be
      made available directly on the cloud server supporting the
      tunnel endpoint, possibly mapped to a different port. The use
      of a tunnel for NAT traversal is shown in <a href=
      "#wot_client_thing_tunnel" class="fig-ref" title=
      "WoT Thing and WoT Client via Tunnel">Figure <span class=
      "figno">8</span></a>.</p>
      <figure id="wot_client_thing_tunnel">
        <img src="images/tunnel.svg" style="width: 1000px;" width=
        "1006" height="399">
        <figcaption>
          Figure <span class="figno">8</span> <span class=
          "fig-title">WoT Thing and WoT Client via Tunnel</span>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In this configuration the WoT Thing must be responsible
      for all security, including (if necessary) certificates
      appropriate for the tunnel endpoint in the cloud. i This
      implies that the WoT Thing needs to be relatively powerful,
      as constrained devices may not be able to support security
      mechanisms suitable for direct exposure on the internet. The
      WoT Thing would also have to be actively maintained and
      patched. If the WoT thing provides a TD, it should use URLs
      that refer to the tunnel endpoint. This generally means that
      the port used for the local side of the tunnel should not be
      used to provide local connections as the certificates will be
      incorrect for local connections. Instead a separate port (and
      possibly a separate TD with local URLs) should be
      provided.</p>
      <p>One advantage of this arrangement is that communication is
      never available in plaintext on either the gateway or the
      client. Specifically, the private keys for end-to-end
      communication between the WoT Thing and the WoT Client,
      assuming a secure protocol such as HTTPS is used, never need
      to be made available to either the local gateway or to the
      cloud portal. In other words, this configuration supports
      end-to-end encrypted communication, and does not rely on
      trusting either the gateway or the cloud portal. Because of
      this, it is not technically necessary for the tunnel to be
      over SSH; a regular IP tunnel would suffice.</p>
      <p>A variation of this is shown in <a href=
      "#wot_client_thing_proxy" class="fig-ref" title=
      "WoT Thing and WoT Client via HTTPS/HTTP Proxy">Figure
      <span class="figno">9</span></a>. A reverse tunnel is still
      used here, but terminates in a local port "inside" the cloud
      portal, that is, the local port is not made visible outside
      the cloud portal's firewall. A local proxy service then runs
      inside the cloud portal and provides a bridge to a secure
      external network interface. For example, the protocol from
      the WoT Thing might be HTTP, which the proxy service could
      bridge to an external HTTPS network interface. In this case,
      the tunnel should be encrypted (for example, using SSH) to
      prevent eavesdropping; a regular IP tunnel is not sufficient.
      Depending on the configuration, the unencrypted traffic (e.g.,
      HTTP) may also be visible on the local network. In this case,
      the only protection would be from that provided by the local
      network, e.g., WPA. If such a relatively unprotected local
      interface is <em>not</em> desirable, another SSH tunnel can be
      used between the WoT Thing and the Gateway, or the WoT Thing
      can act as its own gateway (with the HTTP traffic protected
      behind a firewall).</p>
      <p>To support local SSH tunnels, of course credentials need
      to be provisioned between the gateway and the cloud portal.
      However, this only needs to be done once, when the gateway is
      installed.</p>
      <p>It is worth emphasizing that the security in this
      configuration is weaker than in the end-to-end tunnel
      configuration. In particular, unencrypted traffic is
      available both locally (on the local network and/or inside
      the gateway) and in the cloud portal. Therefore both the
      gateway and the cloud portal need to be trusted. This can be
      mitigated somewhat by using application-level end-to-end
      object security [<cite><a class="bibref" href=
      "#bib-cose17">COSE17</a></cite>].</p>

      <p>Yet another variant of this approach is shown in <a href=
      "#wot_client_thing_proxy" class="fig-ref" title=
      "WoT Thing and WoT Client via HTTPS/HTTP Proxy">Figure
      <span class="figno">9</span></a>. In this variant, the proxy
      is extended to support caching. This means that the proxy may
      not always forward requests to the WoT Thing, but may instead
      respond on its behalf using stored state.</p>
      <p>There are two sub-variants of this approach. First, a
      simple HTTP Proxy can be used that caches responses from the
      WoT Thing. For example, property reads might return an exact
      copy of an earlier cached payload if only a small amount of
      time (for some configurable value of "small") has elapsed
      since the last request for that property. However, this
      approach still requires that the WoT Thing be "always on" and
      able to respond as a server in case cached content is not
      available or has expired. It also requires some care on the
      part of the WoT Thing to mark payloads as cacheable or
      uncacheable and configure appropriate time-to-live
      values.</p>
      <figure id="wot_client_thing_cachingproxy">

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The second sub-variant, shown in <a href=
      "#wot_client_thing_cachingproxy" class="fig-ref" title=
      "WoT Thing and WoT Client via HTTPS/HTTP Proxy">Figure
      <span class="figno">10</span></a>, takes advantage of the
      metadata provided by the Thing Description. Specifically, the
      Thing Description indicates which interactions are
      "properties" that can be "observed". The proxy service can
      "observe" all such properties and maintain copies of their
      state in the cloud server (it is also possible to do this in
      the gateway, a sub-variant of this pattern). Then when a
      request comes in to read a property, it can be read from the
      stored state. However, the "observe" pattern allows the WoT
      Thing to send updates on its own schedule, leading to greater
      power efficiency. In addition, the proxy service can see from
      the Thing Description which network interface methods are
      "actions" and need to be sent directly to the WoT Thing. This
      reduces the need for the WoT Thing to mark interactions as
      being cacheable or not. <!--
           The cache functionality can either be combined with the security endpoint proxy or can be instantiated
           as a separate service.  Conceptually the functions are distinct. --></p>
      <p>In both of these sub-patterns, object security (that is,
      encryption and authentication of payloads at the application
      level) can be used to preserve confidentiality and integrity
      if necessary [<cite><a class="bibref" href=
      "#bib-cose17">COSE17</a></cite>]. A caching proxy can simply
      store and return copies of the encrypted data representing
      the state of "private" properties.</p>
      <p>A caching proxy, being a variant of the proxy
      configuration discussed above, has similar security
      caveats.</p>

      <p>Since all scripts running inside the WoT runtime are
      considered trusted for this scenario, there is no strong need
      to perform strict isolation between each running script
      instance. However, depending on device capabilities and
      deployment use case scenario risk level it might be desirable
      to do so. For example, if one script handles sensitive
      privacy-related data and well-audited, it might be desirable
      to separate it from the rest of the script instances to
      minimize the risk of data exposure in case some other script
      inside WoT gets compromised during the runtime. Such
      isolation can be performed within the WoT Runtime using
      platform security mechanisms available on the device.</p>
      <p>Depending on the device capabilities, the following
      isolation mechanisms might be available:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>WoT Runtime enforced isolation.</strong> This
        is the basic isolation provided by the WoT Runtime itself
        and is based on restricting the API exposed to the scripts
        running within the WoT Runtime. The exact set of guarantees
        depends on the concrete WoT Runtime implementation and
        might vary.</li>
        <li><strong>Native OS process-based isolation.</strong>
        This method relies on the underlying native OS to provide
        basic isolation guarantees based on native process
        isolation. The exact set of guarantees depends on
        capabilities of native OS, but it usually includes at least
        memory and execution content isolation. Some other
        mechanisms like Discretionary Access Controls (DAC) might
        be also available.</li>
        <li><strong>Native OS advanced isolation.</strong> An OS
        might also provide a stronger set of measures that can be
        deployed for process-based isolation. Examples of such
        measures are Mandatory access Control (MACs in all major
        OSes), OS-level virtualization (i.e. namespaces and
        containers in Linux), Cryptographic methods etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The mechanisms are provided in the order from weakest to
      the strongest isolation method and can be used in
      combination. In order to choose the appropriate mechanism one
      should study the capabilities of the underlying device, as
      well as evaluate the risk level of particular deployment
      scenario. <!--
            See Section <a href="#determine-suitable-architecture"></a> for more details on how to evaluate the risk level. 
            -->
       It is also important to note that all isolation mechanisms
      usually affect performance and might require non-trivial
      policy setup and management.</p>
      <p>Now if we consider the basic communication scenario
      between the WoT Client and the device exposing the WoT Thing
      described in Section <a href="#wot-client-server-basic"
      class="sec-ref"><span class="secno">7.1</span> <span class=
      "sec-title">Basic Interaction between WoT Thing and WoT
      Client</span></a> from a perspective of script instances
      running inside WoT Runtime, each such instance should be able
      to have a way to perform mutual authentication between itself
      and a remote WoT Client or support a token-based
      authentication method. However, there are no methods in the
      WoT Scripting API to perform any such tasks. Instead the
      underlying WoT Runtime and protocol bindings handle the
      required security functionality transparently for the WoT
      scripts. <a href="#wot_scripts_security_1" class="fig-ref"

      done, when a WoT Script discovers a new WoT Thing,

      invokes an action "toggle".</p>

      authentication and authorization methods and corresponding
      credentials) are not exposed to the WoT Scripts, but handled
      by the WoT Runtime and underlying protocol bindings, WoT
      Scripts must either rely on the WoT Runtime to use the
      default credentials provisioned to it, or indicate the choice
      of security methods and credentials using a name/id tag known
      to the WoT Runtime.</p>

      <p>The case of the multi-tenant servient with a possibility
      to install WoT Scripts remotely into WoT Runtimes brings an
      additional set of threats that must be taken into account:

      <p>In order to address these threats one should utilize the
      strongest isolation method available on the device to
      separate different WoT Runtimes. The isolation should cover
      execution context, runtime memory, local storage and resource
      allocation between different WoT Runtimes.</p>
      <p>In addition the Thing Manager should have a reliable way
      to distinguish between different tenants in order to securely
      manage provisioning and updates of scripts into the
      corresponding WoT Runtime. This can be achieved by
      authenticating the tenant using one of the authentication
      methods described in Section <a href=
      "#wot-client-server-basic" class="sec-ref"><span class=
      "secno">7.1</span> <span class="sec-title">Basic Interaction

        <p class="">Do we want to describe/point to examples how
        provisioning could be done?</p>
      </div>
      <p>Also each tenant inside the WoT runtime requires a
      different set of security credentials to be provisioned and
      made accessible for its scripts. These credentials should be
      also strictly isolated between different tenants.</p>
